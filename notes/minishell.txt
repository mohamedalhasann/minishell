minishell
what is bash? is the shell,or command language interpreter
what is a shell? a macro processor that executes commands

Shells may be used interactively or non-interactively. 
In interactive mode, they accept input typed from the keyboard. 
When executing non-interactively, shells execute commands read from a file or a string.

Token:
A sequence of characters considered a single unit by the shell. It is either a word or an operator.

shell operation :
1.reads command , this command is input from a file or a string
a file would be a script file,which is mostly made up of a set of commands or strings
2.tokenization:splitting the characters into parts, or tokens. tokens are seperated by meta-characters
3.command identification: understanding structure(knowing how many commands,where pipes are, execution order), this is parsing
4.command expansion : 
variable : (echo $USER becomes: -> echo mohamed)
tilde : (ls ~) becomes -> ls /home/mohamed
5.quote removal :
echo '$USER' -> prints $USER
echo "$USER" -> prints mohamed
6.redirections : 
echo hi > out.txt
final execution argv -> argv = ["echo","hi",NULL];

7.execution:
if builtin : run directly without execve
if external:
    shell does : 
        fork()
        execve()
        wait()
what is a TTY?
a communication channel between keyboard,screen and processes /dev/tty

:::::
Parent Process Flow
|
fork() -----> child process
                    |
                    execve to command
                    |
wait()   <-------   exit(status)
|
continue

my approach for execution : 
checking if the command sent is valid , and i found its path
then checking redirections , if the struct of the redirection is null , then ill do a simple execution for a simple command function 

applying redirection until there is somehting error like open() error, 
or file not found
i already did the find_command_path function, the next step is the actual execution
